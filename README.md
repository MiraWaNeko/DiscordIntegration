This mod combines your Discord to your Minecraft server.

This is a server-side mod and therefore don't need to be on the client.

It comes with 3 commands that can be used on Discord.

*   `!online` - Shows players online on the server
*   `!tps` - Shows the TPS (Ticks Per Second)
*   `!unstuck <playername>` - Moves a player to spawn

You can also add custom commands that will execute a Minecraft command.

There is also the ability to disable, add aliases and limit usage to specific roles on commands.

It allows you to configure which messages should be sent between Discord and Minecraft.

    *   Chat
